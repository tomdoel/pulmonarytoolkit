# Installing the Pulmonary Toolkit

The recomended way to use the PTK is to obtain the code using git and run
it using Matlab.

```{tip}
Alternatively, if you want to run PTK without Matlab, you can run an older version as a pre-built executable. See [Installing without Matlab](../user-guide/installing-without-matlab) for more information.
```

## 1. Required software

You should have the following software installed before continuing:
 * Matlab version R2010b or later
 * The Matlab Image Processing Toolbox
 * A C++ compiler
 * A git client (eg git command line, GitHub Desktop, SourceTree)

Please see [Required Software](required-software.md) for more information about how to install these.


## 2. Download the Pulmonary Toolkit using git

The main PTK codebase lives on GitHub: https://github.com/tomdoel/pulmonarytoolkit.
To obtain the code, you clone it using your git client.

### Using a command-line git client
You can clone PTK using the following command:

```console
