# Installing the Pulmonary Toolkit without Matlab

If you do not need to develop your own plugins and scripts, you can run the Pulmonary Toolkit without a Matlab license by installing a pre-built release: https://github.com/tomdoel/pulmonarytoolkit/releases

Each release has two executables; the PTK GUI runs the full graphical user interface, or you can use PTK Command-Line to run pre-compiled scripts from a command prompt/terminal window or batch file/shell script.

The pre-built releases are compiled using specific versions of Matlab. In order to run them, you will need to install the free Matlab Runtime (MCR) for the exact same version of Matlab. On Windows, you also need to install the free Visual C++ Redistributable. Details are provided on the release page: https://github.com/tomdoel/pulmonarytoolkit/releases
Pre-built releases do not provide an update mechanism, and you cannot write your own plugins or scripts.
