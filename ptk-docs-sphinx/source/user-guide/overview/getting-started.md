# Getting started


## Requirements

  * A recent version of Matlab


## Downloading and Installing

Download the current version of the entire Pulmonary Toolkit and place in a folder on your Matlab path.

If you have a C++ compiler, you should ensure Matlab is set up to use it by calling
```
mex -setup
```
in the Matlab command window, and follow the instructions to set up Matlab's mex compiler.

The C++ compiler is optional, but segmentation features of the Pulmonary Toolkit (alpha version) will not function without it.

_Note: The installer script sets up Matlab's C++ mex compiler and uses this to compile certain functions used by the Toolkit. For more information about mex, type_`doc mex`_at the Matlab command window. For Windows and Mac you may need to install a C++ compiler before running the install script. XCode (for Mac) or Visual Studio (for Windows) will install compilers on your system._

## Data

The toolkit is designed for use with high-resolution CT and MRI clinical lung images in 3D. Other types of image may work but are not officially supported.

Data can be imported in a variety of formats. You should import from original DICOM files where available, so that the toolkit can make use of its metadata.


## PTKViewer#

PTKViewer is a standalone application for visualising 3D or 2D data slice-by-slice. See the page [PTKViewer](../features/PTKViewer.md) for more information


## Running the Pulmonary Toolkit user interface

To run the PTK gui, run
```
ptk
```
The use the Import button to import data
