# MIV

The Medical Imaging Viewer (miv) is a GUI similar to the PTK GUI but for general-purpose (not lung-specific) use.
MIV provides access to the MIM toolkit upon which PTK is built, without the lung-specific restrictions.

To run miv, execute from the Matlab Command Window:
```
> miv
```

MIV is currently experimental and may cause some issues if interacting with the same data as PTK.
