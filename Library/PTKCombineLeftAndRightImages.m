function combined_image = PTKCombineLeftAndRightImages(template, left, right, left_and_right_lungs)
    % PTKCombineLeftAndRightImages. Combines images representing the left and
    %     right lungs. Typically this is used after image filtering has been
    %     separately performed on the two lungs to reduce memory usage.
    %
    %     Many examples of usage can be found in Toolkit plugins.
