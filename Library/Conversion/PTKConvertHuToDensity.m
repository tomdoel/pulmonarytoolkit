function density_values_g_ml = PTKConvertHuToDensity(hu_values)
    % Convert density values in HU to g/ml
    %
    % PTKConvertHuToDensity converts the HU values in the vector hu_values to
    % the approximate values of mass density, assuming a linear
    % relationshoip between radiodensity values and mass density.
    %
    % Note: this is often a reasonable approximation, but it depends on the
    %     scanner and the material being scanned. 
    %
    % The output will be a vector containing density values in g/mL.
    %
    % Syntax:
    %     density_values_g_ml = PTKConvertHuToDensity(hu_values);
    %
    % Parameters:
    %     hu_values: Vector of density values in HU
    %
    % Returns:
    %     density_values_g_ml: Vector of density values in g/mL
