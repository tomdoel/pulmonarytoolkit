function output_image = PTKSimpleRegionGrowing(threshold_image, start_points_global, reporting)
    % PTKSimpleRegionGrowing. Performs 3D region growing through the supplied
    %     binary threshold image, starting from the specified points
    %
    %
    %     Syntax:
    %         output_image = PTKSimpleRegionGrowing(threshold_image, start_points_global, reporting)
    %
    %         Inputs:
    %         ------
    %             threshold_image - The threshold image in a PTKImage class. 1s
    %                 represents voxels which are connected
    %             start_points - an array of points, where each point is a
    %                 coordinate in the form [i, j, k]. The region growing will
    %                 begin from all these points simultaneously
    %             reporting - an object implementing CoreReportingInterface
    %                             for reporting progress and warnings
    %
    %         Outputs:
    %         -------
    %             output_image - A binary PTKImage containing the segmented region
    %                 of all voxels connected to the starting points
