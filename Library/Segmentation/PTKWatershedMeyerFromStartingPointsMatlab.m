function labeled_output = PTKWatershedMeyerFromStartingPointsMatlab(image, starting_labels)
    % Implementation of Meyer flooding algorithm.
    %
    % Attention:
    %     This is a Matlab-only implementation of the mex function
    %     PTKWatershedMeyerFromStartingPoints. It exists to prodive an alternative if the mex function
    %     cannot be compiled or for testing purposes.
    %
    %     Use the mex function PTKWatershedMeyerFromStartingPoints instead of using this function 
    %     if possible, as that is faster. 
    %
    % Parameters:
    %     image: 16-bit ingeter image (int16). The watershed regions grow according to the minima of these points
    %     starting_labels: 8-bit integer (int8). Labels of starting points for the watershed
    %     labeled_output: 8-bit integer (int8). Labels of the image assigned to
    %         watershed regions. Watershed points are given the label -2
    %
    %     The watershed starts from the positive-valued labels in
    %     starting_labels and grows out into the zero-valued points, with the
    %     result returned in labeled_output. Regions starting from points with
    %     the same label can merge together. Negative labels are treated as
    %     fixed barriers. The do not grow and other regions cannot grow into
    %     them.
