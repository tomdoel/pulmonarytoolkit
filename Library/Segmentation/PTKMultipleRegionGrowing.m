function output_image = PTKMultipleRegionGrowing(threshold_image, start_points_global, reporting)
    % PTKMultipleRegionGrowing. Performs 3D region growing of several regions
    %      simultaneously through the supplied binary threshold image, beginning
    %      at the specified starting points for each region.
    %
    %
    %     Syntax:
    %         output_image = PTKMultipleRegionGrowing(threshold_image, start_points_global, reporting)
    %
    %         Inputs:
    %         ------
    %             threshold_image - The threshold image in a PTKImage class. 1s
    %                 represents voxels which are connected
    %             start_points - an set of starting points, where each element
    %                 in the set is array of points representing one region.
    %                 Each point is a global index. The region growing will 
    %                 begin from all these points simultaneously
    %             reporting - an object implementing CoreReportingInterface
    %                             for reporting progress and warnings
    %
    %         Outputs:
    %         -------
    %             output_image - A binary PTKImage containing the segmented region
    %                 of all voxels connected to the starting points
