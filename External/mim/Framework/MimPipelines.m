classdef MimPipelines < CoreBaseClass
    % MimPipelines. Part of the internal framework of the TD MIM Toolkit.
    %
    %     This class is used to execute Plugins automatically, triggered by
    %     the completion of other Plugins. This automatic triggering is
    %     called a Pipeline. A Pipeline might be used to perform some
    %     automatic operation.
    
    %     Pipelines can also be used to more efficiently
    %     generate results which depend on some other result. For example,
    %     suppose plugins A and B depends on plugin C, but suppose you do
    %     not wish to cache the results of C permanently. Calling A will
    %     result in a call to C; it may be efficient to also compute B
    %     while the result of C is available in memory. This can be accomplished by
    %     creating a pipeline such that B is called automatically when C is
    %     run. For this to work, the result of C should have its memory
    %     cache policy set to at least temporary.
