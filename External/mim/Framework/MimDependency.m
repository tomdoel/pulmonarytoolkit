    %     MimDependency sores a dependency object, uniquely tagging a particular 
    %     result generated from running a plugin. This dependency is stored 
    %     alongside the plugin result and stored in the
    %     dependency list of every plugin which uses this result. This allows us
    %     to determine that a result is still valid, because its dependencies
    %     still match the dependency objects in the cache.
