classdef MimSuggestEditException < MException
    % Error that can be overcome using a manual edit.
    %
    % MimSuggestEditException is raised when an error occurs in certain
    % Plugins. Normally a plugin failure would mean that no clients of
    % the Plugin can be used. However, if a manual edit can be created
    % to replace the plugin call, clients of the Plugin can continue.
    % This exception is used to indicate to the caller (the GUI or the
    % caller of the API) that it might be possible to create a manual
    % edit for this purpose, and indicates the Plugin for which the
    % manual edit should occur. While it is possible to create a manual
    % edit for any Plugin, it is simpler from a user perspective to
    % only allow creation of manual edits for certain meaningful Plugins
