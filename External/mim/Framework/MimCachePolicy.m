classdef MimCachePolicy
    % Enumeration describing the type of caching allowed for a plugin result
    %
    % Plugins can define caching policy for the disk and memory caches.
    % Not all values are supported by each cache type.
    %
    % - Off:
    %     Never cache results. This means the plugin will be run every time. 
    %
    %     For the memory cache, use this value if: 
    %         a) the execution time is very fast, or
    %         b) the plugin result is very large and you do not want
    %            it to consume memory, or
    %         c) the plugin result is only requested once by a
    %            single plugin and you will no be requesting the
    %            result directly
    %
    %     For the disk cache, only use this value if:
    %         a) the execution time is very fast, or
    %         b) the plugin result is only requested once by a
    %            single plugin and you will no be requesting the
    %            result directly
    %
    % - Temporary:
    %     Only valid for memory cache. This means the result
    %     will be cached in memory until the end of the original
    %     API call GetResult(). This value is useful if a plugin
    %     result will be requested multiple times by one or more
    %     plugins during a single API call, but the result is
    %     not likely to be required outside of this.
    %
    % - Session:
    %     The result will be deleted when the MimDataset object
    %     is destroyed, typically when you move onto a different
    %     dataset. This is useful when you want the speed
    %     advantages: of a cache only while you are working on a
    %     dataset:
    %
    % - Permanent:
    %     Only valid for a disk cache. The cache result will
    %     remain in the dataset until the cache is cleared
