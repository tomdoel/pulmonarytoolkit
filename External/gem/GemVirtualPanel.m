classdef GemVirtualPanel < GemUserInterfaceObject
    % GEM class for a panel which has no underlying graphical component.
    %
    % GemVirtualPanel represents a GEM panel which does not have an underlying
    % Matlab panel component. In other words, the VirtualPanel acts like a real
    % panel to GEM, but any Matlab components which act on it are actually
    % acting on the parent panel handle.
    %
    % The purpose of a GemVirtualPanel is to simplify user interface design by
    % allowing the separation of a panel into smaller panels without introducing
    % the overhead of creating additional graphical objects.
