classdef PTKAirwaysSimplePrunedImage < PTKPlugin
    % PTKAirwaysSimplePrunedImage. Plugin for creating an image of the
    % airways pruned at approximately the segmental bronchi level.
    %
    %     This plugin does not attempt to perform advanced segmental
    %     anlaysis of the tree; instead it prunes the tree after the child
    %     branches of the lobar bronchi. If there are no child branches for
    %     a lobar bronchus, it is not changed. Since there is no segmental
    %     anlaysis, this plugin is more robust to failures to find the
    %     pulmonary segments. But it is also means the level of pruning is
    %     not consistent between different images, as it depends on which
    %     airways were found for each.
    %
    % This is a plugin for the Pulmonary Toolkit. Plugins can be run using 
    % the gui, or through the interfaces provided by the Pulmonary Toolkit.
    % See PTKPlugin.m for more information on how to run plugins.
    %
    % Plugins should not be run directly from your code.
