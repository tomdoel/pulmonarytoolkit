#summary Information for first time users

= Requirements =

 * A recent version of Matlab 

= Downloading and Installing =

Download the current version of the entire Pulmonary Toolkit and place in a folder on your Matlab path.

If you have a C++ compiler, then run the `install.m` script by typing
{{{
install
}}}
in the Matlab command window, and follow the instructions to set up Matlab's mex compiler.

The installer step is optional, but certain features of the Pulmonary Toolkit (alpha version) will not function without it.

_The installer script sets up Matlab's C++ mex compiler and uses this to compile certain functions used by the Toolkit. For more information about mex, type `doc mex` at the Matlab command window. For Windows and Mac you may need to install a C++ compiler before running the install script. XCode (for Mac) or Visual Studio (for Windows) will install compilers on your system._

= Data = 

The toolkit is designed for use with high-resolution CT and MRI clinical lung images in 3D. Other types of image may work but are not officially supported.

Data can be imported in a variety of formats. You should import from original DICOM files where available, so that the toolkit can make use of its metadata.

= TDViewer =

TDViewer is a standalone application for visualising 3D or 2D data slice-by-slice. See the page [TDViewer] for more information
