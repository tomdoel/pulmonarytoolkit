classdef PTKMain < MimMain
    % PTKMain. Imports and provides access to data from the Pulmonary Toolkit
    %
    %     PTKMain is a specialist implementation of the MimMain class.
    %
    %     PTKMain provides access to data from the Pulmonary Toolkit, and allows 
    %     you to import new data. Data is accessed through one or more MimDataset
    %     objects. Your code should create a single PTKMain object, and then ask
    %     it to create a MimDataset object for each dataset you wish to access. 
    %
    %     PTKMain is essentially a class factory for MimDatasets, but shares the 
    %     MimReportingInterface (error/progress reporting) objects between all 
    %     datasets, so you have a single error/progress reporting pipeline for 
    %     your use of the Pulmonary Toolkit.
    %
    %     To import a new dataset, construct a MimImageInfo object with the file
    %     path and file name set to the image file. For DICOM files it is only
    %     necessary to specify the path since all image files in that directory
    %     will be imported. Then call CreateDatasetFromInfo. PTKMain will import
    %     the data (if it has not already been imported) and return a new
    %     MimDataset object for that dataset.
    %
    %     To access an existing dataset you can use CreateDatasetFromInfo as
    %     above, or you can use CreateDatasetFromUid to retrieve a dataset which
    %     has peviously been imported, using the UID that was associated with
    %     that dataset.
    %
    %     Example
    %     -------
    %     Replace <image path> and <filenames> with the path and filenames
    %     to your image data.
    %
    %         image_info = MimImageInfo( <image path>, <filenames>, [], [], [], []);
    %         ptk = PTKMain;
    %         dataset = ptk.CreateDatasetFromInfo(image_info);
    %
    %     You can then obtain results from this dataset, e.g.
    %
    %         airways = dataset.GetResult('PTKAirways');
